# homebrew-custom

A directory of custom homebrew formulae [that can't be put in the main repos for some reason](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Acceptable-Casks.md#rejected-casks), but are still useful to me.

## Usage

```shell
brew tap thatrobotdev/custom    # install
brew untap thatrobotdev/custom  # uninstall
```

[You can find more information about 3rd party repositories (taps) in homebrew's docs.](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps)
